            <h1>UNITY SUMMER 2019</h1>
            <p>I wrote my first piece for the Glasgow University Magazine (GUM) on the evolution of subcultures. This piece was for the style section and was published in the summer 2019 issue; 'Unity'. I was able to draw on my interest in trends and the sociology behind them in order to write this article.</p>

            <h1>HYPE WEEK</h1>
            <p>During refreshers week in January 2020 or 'Hype Week', I wrote a science article for GUM's online platform about eco-anxiety. I enjoyed writing my first science article as it allowed me to explore and express my strong, personal views about the climate crisis.</p>

            <h1>SOMETHING IN THE WATER</h1>
            <p>For the Spring 2020 issue; 'Something in the Water', I wrote another science piece. This one was focused on the psychology behind cult behavior and their leaders. I found writing this piece very rewarding as it required a lot of personal research and taught me a great deal.</p>

            <h1>BLOSSOM ZINE</h1>
            <p>Blossom Zine was a one-off, student-run publication created to raise money for Glasgow Women's Aid. The zine primarily explored femininity and gender-based violence so my piece was centred around traditional attitudes to gender-based violence. This was a very difficult and sensitive article to write as the topic is very personal to me, so I was delighted that the zine sales raised over Â£400.</p>
